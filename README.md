### overview and purpose

Welcome to my project portfolio, This readme file provides a brief overview of the various projects I have undertaken, showcasing my skills and expertise in the realm of software development and web aplications.

## Functionality and Features

* The portfolio presents itself with a very minimalistic and classic style in black and white greyscale which I took inspiration from the apple's websites, very few colours are used to keep the user focus on what’s relevant and to deliver a clean, functional and profesional look.

* The portfolio layout presents all the different main sections displayed in one singular page that can be navigated scrolling down in order trough:
About, Experience, Blog and Contacts. Alternatively all section can be access through the navigation bar that upon input redirects the user to its related section of the same page utilising an html “Id=##” for each section improving user experience and navigation.

* My personal favourite function would be definitely the hamburger menu that is displayed when the viewport changes below 1200px, the hamburger menu is slightly animated a and is made using only html and css. The function of the hamburger menu is to solve the problem of space and functionality when the portfolio is visualising in small viewports.

* Through the portfolio various animations can be found like the loading of the experience bars in the experience section or the hoover selector when hovering trough buttons or blogposts all to enhance the user's experience through interaction with the page.

* Emojis are inserted throughout the webpage in each section using their equivalent Hexadecimal value in html, giving to the user a much more friendly experience without the need to use images.


## Sitemap

As mentioned abouve the portfoliio's layout makes all the different sections accessible in the same page through scrolling down with the exception of the blog section where interacting with each singular blog post will redirect the user to a single post page within a separate html file.
Inside the single blog post page the user will be able to navigate back to any section of the main page using the navigation bar on the header or the hamburger menu if on mobile devices.
